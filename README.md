# libLinearCollection

**libLinearCollection** is a custom library designed to provide implementations of fundamental linear data structures, including:

- Singly Linked Nodes
- Array-based Lists
- Stacks
- Queues

## Features

- **Singly Linked Nodes**: Efficiently store and traverse data using a simple node-based structure.
- **Array-based Lists**: Implement dynamic arrays for storing data.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Implement LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) collections for efficient data management.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juanserealpe/libLinearCollection.git
```

## Usage

To use the library, simply import the necessary classes and structures into your project. Examples for each data structure can be found in the documentation.
